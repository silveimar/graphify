# Changelog

Full release notes with details on each version: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify/releases)

## 0.3.18 (2026-04-09)

- Fix: `--watch` mode now respects `.graphifyignore` — `_rebuild_code` was calling `collect_files()` directly instead of `detect()`, bypassing ignore patterns (#120)
- Fix: Codex PreToolUse hook now uses `systemMessage` instead of `additionalContext` — Codex does not support `additionalContext` and was returning an error (#121)
- Fix: Trae link corrected from `trae.com` to `trae.ai` in README, README.zh-CN.md, README.ja-JP.md, README.ko-KR.md (#122)
- Docs: Korean README added (README.ko-KR.md) (#112)
- Refactor: `save_query_result` inline Python blocks in all 6 skill files replaced with `graphify save-result` CLI command — shorter, maintainable, less tokens for LLM (#114)
- Add: `graphify save-result` CLI subcommand — saves Q&A results to memory dir without inline Python

## 0.3.17 (2026-04-08)

- Add: Julia (.jl) support — modules, structs, abstract types, functions, short functions, using/import, call edges, inherits edges via tree-sitter-julia (#98)
- Fix: Semantic extraction chunks now group files by directory so related artifacts land in the same chunk, reducing missed cross-chunk relationships (#65)
- Fix: `tree-sitter>=0.21` now pinned in dependencies — prevents silent empty AST output when older tree-sitter is installed with newer language bindings (#52)
- Add: Progress output every 100 files during AST extraction so large projects don't appear to hang (#52)

## 0.3.16 (2026-04-08)

- Fix: `graphify query`, `serve`, and `benchmark` now work on NetworkX < 3.4 — version-safe shim for `node_link_graph()` at all call sites (#95)
- Fix: `.jsx` files now detected and extracted via the JS extractor — added to `CODE_EXTENSIONS` and `_DISPATCH` (#94)
- Fix: `.graphify_python` no longer deleted in Step 9 cleanup across all 6 skill files — pipx users no longer hit `ModuleNotFoundError` on follow-up commands (#92)

## 0.3.15 (2026-04-08)

- Feat: Trae and Trae CN platform support (`graphify install --platform trae` / `trae-cn`)
- Fix: `skill-droid.md` was missing from PyPI package data — Factory Droid users couldn't install the skill
- Fix: XSS in HTML legend — community labels now HTML-escaped before `innerHTML` injection
- Fix: Shebang allowlist validation in `hooks.py` and all 6 skill files — prevents metacharacter injection from malicious binaries
- Fix: `louvain_communities()` kwargs now inspected at runtime for cross-version NetworkX compatibility
- Fix: pipx installs now detected correctly in git hooks (reads shebang from graphify binary)
- Fix: graspologic ANSI escape codes no longer corrupt PowerShell 5.1 scroll buffer
- Docs: Japanese README added
- Docs: `graph.json` + LLM workflow example added to README
- Docs: Codex PreToolUse hook now documented in platform table

## 0.3.14 (2026-04-08)

- Fix: `graphify codex install` now also writes a PreToolUse hook to `.codex/hooks.json` so the graph reminder fires before every Bash tool call (#86)
- Fix: `--update` now prunes ghost nodes from deleted files before merging new extraction (#51)

## 0.3.13 (2026-04-08)

- Fix: PreToolUse hook now outputs `additionalContext` JSON so Claude actually sees the graph reminder before Glob/Grep calls (#83)
- Fix: Go AST method receivers and type declarations now use package directory scope, eliminating disconnected duplicate type nodes across files in the same package (#85)
- Fix: PDFs inside Xcode asset catalogs (`.imageset`, `.xcassets`) are no longer misclassified as academic papers (#52)
- Fix: `_resolve_cross_file_imports` is now guarded with `if py_paths` and wrapped in try/except so a Python parser crash can't abort extraction for non-Python files (#52)
- Fix: Skill intermediate files (`.graphify_*.json`) now live in `graphify-out/` instead of project root, preventing git pollution (#81)

## 0.3.12 (2026-04-07)

- Fix: `sanitize_label` was double-encoding HTML entities in the interactive graph (`&amp;lt;` instead of `&lt;`) — removed `html.escape()` from `sanitize_label`; callers that inject directly into HTML now call `html.escape()` themselves (#66)
- Fix: `--wiki` flag missing from `skill.md` usage table (#55)

## 0.3.11 (2026-04-07)

- Fix: Louvain fallback hangs indefinitely on large sparse graphs — added `max_level=10, threshold=1e-4` to prevent infinite loops while preserving community quality (#48)

## 0.3.10 (2026-04-07)

- Fix: Windows UnicodeEncodeError during `graphify install` — replaced arrow character with `->` in all print statements (#47)
- Add: skill version staleness check — warns when installed skill is older than the current package, across all platforms (#46)

## 0.3.9 (2026-04-07)

- Add: `follow_symlinks` parameter to `detect()` and `collect_files()` — opt-in symlink following with circular symlink cycle detection (#33)
- Fix: `watch.py` now uses `collect_files()` instead of manual rglob loop for consistency
- Docs: Codex uses `$graphify .` not `/graphify .` (#36)
- Test: 5 new symlink tests (367 total)

## 0.3.8 (2026-04-07)

- Add: C# inheritance and interface implementation extraction — `base_list` now emits `inherits` edges for both simple (`identifier`) and generic (`generic_name`) base types (#45)
- Add: `graphify query "<question>"` CLI command — BFS/DFS traversal of `graph.json` without needing Claude Code skill (`--dfs`, `--budget N`, `--graph <path>` flags)
- Test: 2 new C# inheritance tests (362 total)

## 0.3.7 (2026-04-07)

- Add: Objective-C support (`.m`, `.mm`) — `@interface`, `@implementation`, `@protocol`, method declarations, `#import` directives, message-expression call edges
- Add: `--obsidian-dir <path>` flag — write Obsidian vault to a custom directory instead of `graphify-out/obsidian`
- Fix: semantic cache was only saving 4/17 files — relative paths from subagents now resolved against corpus root before existence check
- Fix: 75 validation warnings per run for `file_type: "rationale"` — added `"rationale"` to `VALID_FILE_TYPES`
- Test: 6 Objective-C tests; `.m`/`.mm` added to `test_collect_files_from_dir` supported set (360 total)

## 0.3.0 (2026-04-06)

- Add: multi-platform support — Codex (`skill-codex.md`), OpenCode (`skill-opencode.md`), OpenClaw (`skill-claw.md`)
- Add: `graphify install --platform <codex|opencode|claw>` routes skill to correct config directory
- Add: `graphify codex install` / `opencode install` / `claw install` — writes AGENTS.md for always-on graph-first behaviour
- Add: `graphify claude uninstall` / `codex uninstall` / `opencode uninstall` / `claw uninstall`
- Add: MIT license
- Fix: `build()` was silently dropping hyperedges when merging multiple extractions
- Refactor: `extract.py` 2527 → 1588 lines — replaced 12 copy-pasted language extractors with `LanguageConfig` dataclass + `_extract_generic()`
- Docs: clustering is graph-topology-based (no embeddings) — explained in README
- Docs: all missing flags documented (`--cluster-only`, `--no-viz`, `--neo4j-push`, `query --dfs`, `query --budget`, `add --author`, `add --contributor`)

## 0.2.2 (2026-04-06)

- Add: `graphify claude install` — writes graphify section to local CLAUDE.md + PreToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json`
- Add: `graphify claude uninstall` — removes section and hook
- Add: `graphify hook install` — installs post-commit and post-checkout git hooks (platform-agnostic)
- Add: `graphify hook uninstall` / `hook status`
- Add: `graphify benchmark` CLI command
- Fix: node deduplication documented at all three layers

## 0.1.8 (2026-04-05)

- Fix: follow-up questions now check for wiki first (graphify-out/wiki/index.md) before falling back to graph.json
- Fix: --update now auto-regenerates wiki if graphify-out/wiki/ exists
- Fix: community articles show truncation notice ("... and N more nodes") when > 25 nodes
- UX: pipeline completion message now lists all available flags and commands so users know what graphify can do

## 0.1.7 (2026-04-05)

- Add: `--wiki` flag — generates Wikipedia-style agent-crawlable wiki from the graph (index.md + community articles + god node articles)
- Add: `graphify/wiki.py` module with `to_wiki()` — cross-community wikilinks, cohesion scores, audit trail, navigation footer
- Add: 14 wiki tests (245 total)
- Fix: follow-up question example code now correctly splits node labels by `_` to extract verb prefixes (previous version used `def`/`fn` prefix matching which always returned zero results)

## 0.1.6 (2026-04-05)

- Fix: follow-up questions after pipeline now answered from graph.json, not by re-exploring the directory (was 25 tool calls / 1m30s; now instant)
- Skill: added "Answering Follow-up Questions" section with graph query patterns

## 0.1.5 (2026-04-05)

- Perf: semantic extraction chunks 12-15 → 20-25 files (fewer subagent round trips)
- Perf: code-only corpora skip semantic dispatch entirely (AST handles it)
- Perf: print timing estimate before extraction so the wait feels intentional
- Fix: 5 skill gaps - --graphml in Usage table, --update manifest timing, query/path/explain graph existence check, --no-viz clarity
- Refactor: dead imports removed (shutil, sys, inline os); _node_community_map() helper replaces 8 copy-pasted dict comprehensions; to_html() split into _html_styles() + _html_script(); serve.py call_tool() if/elif chain replaced with dispatch table
- Test: end-to-end pipeline integration test (detect → extract → build → cluster → analyze → report → export)

## 0.1.4 (2026-04-05)

- Replace pyvis with custom vis.js HTML renderer - node size by degree, click-to-inspect panel with clickable neighbors, search box, community filter, physics clustering
- HTML graph generated by default on every run (no flag needed)
- Token reduction benchmark auto-runs after every pipeline on corpora over 5,000 words
- Fix: 292 edge warnings per run eliminated - stdlib/external edges now silently skipped
- Fix: `build()` cross-extraction edges were silently dropped - now merged before assembly
- Fix: `pip install graphify` → `pip install graphifyy` in skill Step 1 (critical install bug)
- Add: `--graphml` flag implemented in skill pipeline (was documented but not wired up)
- Remove: pyvis dependency, dead lib/ folder, misplaced eval reports from tests/
- Add: 5 HTML renderer tests (223 total)

## 0.1.3 (2026-04-04)

- Fix: `pyproject.toml` structure - `requires-python` and `dependencies` were incorrectly placed under `[project.urls]`
- Add: GitHub repository and issues URLs to PyPI page
- Add: `keywords` for PyPI search discoverability
- Docs: README clarifies Claude Code requirement, temporary PyPI name, worked examples footnote

## 0.1.1 (2026-04-04)

- Add: CI badge to README (GitHub Actions, Python 3.10 + 3.12)
- Add: ARCHITECTURE.md - pipeline overview, module table, extraction schema, how to add a language
- Add: SECURITY.md - threat model, mitigations, vulnerability reporting
- Add: `worked/` directory with eval reports (karpathy-repos 71.5x benchmark, httpx, mixed-corpus)
- Fix: pytest not found in CI - added explicit `pip install pytest` step
- Fix: README test count (163 → 212), language table, worked examples links
- Docs: README reframed as Claude Code skill; Karpathy problem → graphify answer framing
