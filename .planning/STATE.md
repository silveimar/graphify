# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17 on v1.4 milestone open)

**Core value:** Graphify can inject knowledge into any Obsidian vault framework driven entirely by a declarative vault-side profile — extended in v1.1 with context persistence and agent memory, in v1.2 with multi-perspective analysis and usage-weighted self-improvement, in v1.3 with token-aware retrieval / entity dedup / interactive slash commands, now being extended in v1.4 to agent discoverability and Obsidian thinking workflows.
**Current focus:** v1.4 requirements definition (parallel research in flight)

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Milestone: v1.4 Agent Discoverability & Obsidian Workflows — 🚧 STARTED (2026-04-17)
Previous milestone: v1.3 Intelligent Analysis Continuation — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-04-17 (phases 9.2 + 10 + 11)
Status: Defining requirements (post-research)
Last activity: 2026-04-17 — Milestone v1.4 opened

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (0/7 phases complete)

**Seeds activated in v1.4:**
- SEED-002 Harness Memory Export — paired with Phase 13

**Seeds still planted:**
- SEED-001 Tacit Elicitation Engine — re-evaluate at v1.5 if onboarding/discovery becomes the milestone theme

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**

- Total plans completed: 38
- Total tests: 872 passing
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-04-09 → 2026-04-11)
- Commits in milestone: ~172

**Velocity (v1.1):**

- Total plans completed: 12
- Total tests: 1,000 passing
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-04-12 → 2026-04-13)
- Commits in milestone: ~117

**Velocity (v1.2):**

- Total plans completed: 9 (3 for Phase 09 autoreason tournament, 3 for Phase 09.1 query telemetry, 3 for Phase 9.1.1 lifecycle cleanup)
- Total tests after milestone: ~1,108 passing
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-04-14 → 2026-04-15) + 1 day planning-only cleanup
- Commits in milestone: ~20 feature commits

**Velocity (v1.3):**

- Total plans completed: 19 (3 for Phase 9.2, 9 for Phase 10, 7 for Phase 11)
- Total tests after milestone: 1,234 passing (+211 over v1.2)
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-04-16 → 2026-04-17)
- Commits in milestone: ~178 (range e60d757–64e8475); +24,057 / −161 lines across 108 files

Detailed per-plan metrics are preserved in phase SUMMARY.md files and in milestone archives (`.planning/milestones/v1.N-*`).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All milestone decisions are archived in:

- **PROJECT.md Key Decisions table** — architectural decisions (D-73, D-74)
- **`.planning/milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`** — v1.0 decision trail
- **`.planning/milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`** — v1.1 decision trail
- **`.planning/milestones/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`** — v1.2 decision trail
- **`.planning/milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`, v1.3-REQUIREMENTS.md** — v1.3 decision trail
- **Phase SUMMARY.md files** — tactical decisions locked during plan execution

Key carry-forward decisions (affect v1.4):

- **D-73**: CLI is utilities-only; skill drives the full pipeline
- **D-74**: `to_obsidian()` is a notes pipeline, not a vault-config-file manager
- **`graph.json` is read-only** — agent state lives in JSONL/JSON sidecars
- **`peer_id` defaults to `"anonymous"`** — never derived from environment (security carry-forward)
- **User sentinel blocks are inviolable** — even under REPLACE strategy
- **D-02 (Phase 9.2)**: MCP responses use hybrid `text_body + SENTINEL + json(meta)` envelope with status codes — all future MCP tools inherit (applies to Phase 13 manifest + Phase 17 chat tool)
- **D-16 (Phase 10)**: MCP `query_graph` transparently redirects merged-away aliases — agent callsites preserved across dedup (applies to Phase 17 chat + Phase 18 focus tools)
- **D-18 (Phase 11)**: New MCP tools should compose existing `analyze.py` / `delta.py` / `snapshot.py` primitives — no new graphify/ modules for plumbing; new analysis algorithms get their own phase (applies to Phase 15 async derivers, Phase 16 argumentation, Phase 17 chat, Phase 18 focus)

### Blockers/Concerns
